# Algorithmic-Toolbox-gas21-
This repository is for my work in the Cousera class, Algorithmic Toolbox. I had already done the class a year ago, but I skipped advanced problems. Now, I am back to solve those.

Note that I only have solutions in Python. Please use them only when you are struck. Do give suggestions if you find a better approach or a more Pythonic way of solving the problem.
